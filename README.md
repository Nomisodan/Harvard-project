## Distinctiveness and Complexity

For this project, I didn’t fully know what “complexity” meant in terms of a web app. So I went with the first thing that came to mind that looked complicated: a dynamic website—something that moves when scrolling through the page.

I decided to build a dynamic welcome page for a website idea similar to TikTok but for mini-games and riddles. Creating something front-end heavy with SCSS and JavaScript was challenging because styles and scripts often conflicted with each other.

For example, if you use an opacity fade-in in CSS but also handle similar logic in JavaScript, things can break. I had to figure out how to implement parallax zoom scrolling, section fade-in/fade-out, animated navigation, carousel zoom sync, and sticky Register/Login forms.

At first, the elements didn’t behave as I expected, and it took me a while to figure everything out. I can’t directly compare it to other projects, but I think this was complex to accomplish due to the multiple pages and functions that could easily conflict with one another.

## Section Breakdown:

**Navigation bar**

Four different section that has a dot that follows your scrolling.

**Intro**  
It starts with a fade-in of the title “Speeme?” (like “Speed Game?”) and a cave entrance background.  
When scrolling starts:
- "Speeme?" zooms out as if you pass by it and disappears behind you.
- The background zooms into the cave.
- "Are you ready?" zooms and fades in from the darkness.

**Explanation**
“Are you ready?” fades out. A new background fades in, and from the bottom, a carousel with the explanation of the game snap-locks in the middle of the page.  
 As users scroll through the carousel, the background zooms in, as if you were walking deeper into the cave while learning what the game is.

**Register**  
Once the carousel is finished, it detaches from the lock. The background keeps zooming in and fades out while the next background fades in.  
At the bottom, the register form comes into view and snap-locks to the screen.

If the user has to register, after completing it it'll beredirected to the main website.

If already registered by scrolling a little more you get to the login section

**Login**  

The background from register zooms in and fades out, then login background fades in and tghe login form comes from the bottom to lock in the middle of the screen. When the user login he is directed to the main website.

**Main website**

This is just a template of the website but it is not the main focus of this project.
